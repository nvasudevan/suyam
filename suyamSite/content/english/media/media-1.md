### My Journey

In 2005 my brother and I came to Siragu Montessori School. We were working with 
the family in the brick kiln. Madam Uma and Muthuraman told our parents that we 
were sending our children to school together. But my parents were reluctant to 
send us to Chennai. Our boss encouraged them and told us to go and study.

The trainings I received at the Siragu Montessori School of Natural Walking and 
Learning Through the Process made education one of my favorites. We wrote the 
tenth exam under the International Curriculum. I got a score of 1047 in the 
twelfth grade.

At first I just wanted to go to Japan and study. I did not go there to study 
because my parents knew that there would be frequent tsunamis. I wanted to be a 
doctor. I told my choice to the self-administrators. According to their 
arrangement, I went to Ukraine to study medicine.

Everyone gets home sick. School Siktan came to me. I was very upset. "If it's 
too difficult there, come on. Your life is in your hands," said our teacher 
Uma. In the freezing cold of -25 C, I put aside the practical difficulties and 
focused on the study.

Dasarathan has now graduated from the National Institute of Open Schooling with a 
six-year degree in medicine at the Crimean Medical State University in Russia 
and studied at the MCI in Delhi.
