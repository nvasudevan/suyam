### OUR JOURNEY

SUYAM Charitable Trust was formally registered under Trust Act in August 1999 
by a group of young college students alongside experienced social workers 
(below 30 years of age) who have been in this service field since 1987.

Our goal is to facilitate the expression of inner potentialities in those who 
have been marginalized through holistic 'Human Making' education. We 
do not want to 'force' progress on the community, especially of the kind that 
is not sustainable and thereby handicaps communities even more.

We aim to provide maximum service to maximum people to the maximum possible 
extent. We attempt to provide a life of dignity to all, a life without 
distinctions based on ability, gender, age, caste, language, region, religion, 
race, class and nationality and opinion.

#### Mission

 * Develop & deploy innovative and effective educational tools tailor-made
   for downtrodden communities
