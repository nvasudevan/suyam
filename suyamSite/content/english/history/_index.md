### How we started?

Suyam started unofficially as a team of volunteers in 1987. We officially 
registered as a public charitable trust in 1999 by Dr. Uma and Muthuram.
In initial days, we began with educating primary children, evening tuitions,
kids entertainment activities, smaller sports activities. We then moved onto
youth programs, creative stimulation camps, blood donation camps, eye donation 
awareness camps. Dr. Uma, being a scout ranger, formed VISHAL ranger team and 
engaged in various social activities. We also carried out several social 
activities, and forest trekkings. After gaining experience in social 
activities for over 12 years, in 1999 we registed as Suyam Charitable trust.   

Suyam's main focus has been and still is education, medical assistance and 
various awareness activities. All of our activities fall under these three 
activities. We met 50 families who were begging in Chennai city and started 
focussing on them, educating them and various other weekend activities.

After 4 years, the families understood and accepted our support and started 
listening us. Based on their request, 40 kms away from Chennai City at their 
locality near IAF Avadi, in a rented premises, we started Siragu Montessori 
School with 30 children in 2003. In July 2003, the then Honourable ex-Governor 
of Tamil Nadu, Mr. P S Ram Mohan Rao visited Siragu and appreciated the efforts 
taken by Suyam. In September 2004, in an unfortunate fire accident, the school 
as totally burnt down. However, the fire accident didn't dampen our spirit and 
within two days, we reset the school in another village. After 6 months, we 
moved to our own land at Palavedu Pettai village, IAF Avadi, Chennai-55.

Now Siragu is in 18th academic year with well over 400 children. In 2015, we 
introduced Higher Secondary Curriculam. Over 5 batches of students have passed 
out from Siragu. <link to success story>. By showing heartfelt gratitude, 
Siargu alumni with available staff conducting classes for available residential 
children even during difficult Covid times. <powerpoint presentation link to

In 2017, we started our Siragu gaushala to save native breeds of India. As of 
now we have 6 cows and 2 calves. To enhance the integrated living students of 
Siragu with the team taking care of the gaushala.<picture> 

Since 2003, we have run our Siragu organic farming at our school, wherein we 
grow organic vegetables which support Siragu kitchen. Our Industrial college 
students help us out. We grow Methi leaves, Tomatoes, Mustard leaves 
etc.<picture>

In 2008, we took over the management of Bharathamatha school in Vyasarapadi, 
Chennai with a strength of 40 children. We bought the premises and 
re-constructed the school with better facilities to educate slum dwellers of 
North Chennai. As of March 2020, we have a strength of 60 children. 

In 2019, we started Siragu Industrial College to provide vocational training 
programmes for economically deprived youths across Tamil Nadu. As of November 
2020, we have a strength of 10 beneficiaries and its growing. All the 10 
beneficiaries are deputed as trainees in an Organic Agri Farm in Pondicherry 
under stipend programme. Also they are studying retail management course named 
BVOC (Bachelors in Vocational Training). 

### Snapshot 

In 2001, a team of ten headed by Dr. Uma camped at Bhuj, Gujarat to provide and 
medical and educational support. We stood up tents to provide medical 
assistance and also took classes for local children.

In 2004, Tsunami stuck Tamil Nadu coastal area. A team of volunteers headed by 
Dr. Uma got on to the fields at Akkarai Pettai, Nagapattinam district to help 
out local fishing comminities in clearing up dead bodies and provided medical 
assistance and food. We also built school facilities (fences, classroom  
furnitures, and a building as an activity center that is still functioning etc.)<pictures> 

In 2006, we were actively involved in supporting communities affected by 
floods.

In 2015, we also supported communities in Tamil Nadu affected by floods. Well 
over 10 districts, over 30,000 families were given food, dry rations, medical 
kits, clothes, bed sheets and much more.

In December 2016, various support were extended to flood victims. We donated 
foods, clothes medical kit and much more.

Since March 2020, we have been supporting communities in Chennai, Kanchipuram, 
Tiruvallur, and Chengalpattu districts affected by Covid. More than 4.5 million 
Rupees have been distributed in the form of food, dry ration, preventive 
medicines, medical kits for children and babies, baby food. We also released 
several covid awareness videos, thanks to Dr. Uma. All of our covid related 
support activities are still ongoing.

In November 2020, the Nivar cyclone struck in the north of Tamil Nadu. We have 
been distributing food, which is continuing as there are constant rains. 

Without the support of many our well-wishers, volunteers, philanthropist, 
instituional and individual donors, we wouldn't have been able to achieve what 
we have achieved so far.
