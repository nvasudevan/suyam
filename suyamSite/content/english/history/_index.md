### How we started?

Suyam started unofficially as a team of volunteers in 1987. We officially 
registered as a public charitable trust in 1999 by Dr. Uma and Muthuram. Our 
main objective was to provide education to children at primary schools, to 
provide additional tuitions, entertainment activities, and organise sports 
activities. We then extended our activities to include youth programs, creative 
stimulation camps, blood donation camps, and eye donation awareness camps.
Dr. Uma, being a scout ranger, formed *VISHAL* ranger team. The VISHAL team organised 
several social activities, and forest trekkings. In 1999, after having served 
our local comminities over 12 years, we registed as **Suyam Charitable trust**.   

Suyam's activities fall under three areas:

 * *education*
 * *medical assistance*
 * *awareness activities*

Our earliest memory was when we met a group of 50 families found begging in 
Chennai. We helped these families by providing education and organising various 
weekend activities. Initially the families were tentative with our help but 
with time, the families began to appreciate our work, and their engagement with 
us improved. From their feedback, we rented a small premise to start *Siragu 
Montessori School* with just 30 children, 40 kms away from Chennai City at a 
small village near IAF Avadi. In July 2003, the then ex-Governor of Tamil Nadu, 
the Rt. Honourable Mr. P S Ram Mohan Rao visited Siragu and appreciated the 
efforts taken by Suyam. In September 2004, in an unfortunate fire accident, our 
school was completely destroyed be the fires. However, the fire accident didn't 
dampen our spirit and within two days, we relocated the school to a 
neighbouring village. After 6 months, we moved to our own land at Palavedu 
Pettai village, IAF Avadi, Chennai.

Now Siragu is in its 18th academic year with well over 400 children. In 2015, 
we introduced Higher Secondary Curriculam, and since then, we have had 5 batches 
of students graduate from Siragu. <link to success story>. By showing 
heartfelt gratitude, Siragu alumni along with our staff, conduct classes for 
available residential children (yes, even during the difficult Covid times).  

In 2017, we started our *Siragu gaushala* (cow shed) to save native breeds of 
India. We have 6 cows and 2 calves. The residential students of Siragu manage the 
gaushala and look after the animals.

Since 2003, we have run an *organic farm* at our Siragu school. We grow organic 
vegetables to support our Siragu kitchen. We grow Methi leaves, Tomatoes, 
Mustard leaves and so on. Our Industrial college students also help us out in 
running our organic farm.

In 2008, we took over the management of *Bharathamatha school* in Vyasarpadi, 
Chennai with a strength of 40 children. We bought the premises and 
re-constructed the school with better facilities to educate slum dwellers of 
North Chennai. As of March 2020, we have a strength of 60 children. 

In 2019, we started *Siragu Industrial College* to provide vocational training 
programmes to support economically deprived youths across Tamil Nadu. As of 
November 2020, we have a strength of 10 beneficiaries and growing!. All the 
beneficiaries are deputed as trainees at Organic Agri Farm based in 
Pondicherry. The students are provided with a small stipend towards educational 
support. Alongside their training at the farm, our students are also studying 
retail management course named BVOC (Bachelors in Vocational Training). 

### Involvement in Crisis

In 2001, when a severe earthquake struck Gujarat, a small team (of ten 
volunteers) headed by our founder, Dr. Uma, camped at Bhuj (a district in 
Gujarat) to provide medical and educational support to local people. We stood 
up tents to provide medical assistance and also took classes for local 
children.

In 2004, *Tsunami* stuck several coastal areas of Tamil Nadu, India. A team of 
volunteers headed by Uma did field work at Akkarai Pettai, Nagapattinam 
district to help out local fishing comminities in clearing up dead bodies and 
provided medical assistance and food. We also built school facilities (fences, 
classroom furnitures, and an activity center) that is still functioning. 

In 2006, we were actively involved in supporting communities affected by 
floods. In 2015, we also supported several local communities in Tamil Nadu 
affected by floods. Well over 10 districts, over 30,000 families were given 
food, dry rations, medical kits, clothes, bed sheets and much more. In December 
2016, support were extended to flood victims - we donated foods, clothes and 
medical kit.

Since March 2020, we have been supporting communities in Chennai, Kanchipuram, 
Tiruvallur, and Chengalpattu districts affected by Covid. We have distributed 
over 4.5 million Rupees in the form of food, dry ration, preventive medicines, 
medical kits for children and babies, and baby food. We have also released 
several covid awareness videos. All of our covid related support activities are 
still ongoing.

In November 2020, the *Nivar cyclone* struck the northern region of Tamil Nadu. 
We have been distributing food, which is continuing as there are constant 
rains. 

Without the support of many our well-wishers, volunteers, philanthropists, 
instituional and individual donors, we wouldn't be here where we are supporting 
local communites.
