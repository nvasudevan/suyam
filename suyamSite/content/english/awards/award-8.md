### About Award

Dr. Uma from Suyam was awarded the *True Hero Award* by Merck India for her 
efforts in teaching underprivileged kids.  Uma as picked by BetterIndia 
(https://www.thebetterindia.com/). Unfortunately we can't seem to find the 
original award page on the BetterIndia site and so we have had to settle for 
the news article.
