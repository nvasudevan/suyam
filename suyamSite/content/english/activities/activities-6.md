### About Activity

Cyclone Nivar has kept the children at Siragu school indoors. Along with the 
students from our Siragu Industrial college, we have started a small vegetable 
and herb garden to grow Methi, Coriander, and Tomato. Please continue to bless 
our children to succeed in all their endeavors.
