Sponsor A Meal campagin initiated by Suyam through its Founder Trustee, 
Muthuram, with an aim to raise contributions by special feeding programs to 
feed the residential children and deserving day scholars of Siragu Montessori 
School and Bharathamatha School.

Whole day special feeding - Rs.24000 (breakfast - Rs.5000, lunch - Rs.10000, snacks - Rs.4000, dinner - Rs.5000).

An appeal to contribute during all the occasions in your family and message us 
the date of feeding and the occasion.

Through this successful initiative we can meet out the food cost as it is 
second top of our operating expenses.
