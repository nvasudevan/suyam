### Sponsor a Meal

Sponsor A Meal campagin initiated by Suyam through its Founder Trustee, 
Muthuram, with an aim to raise contributions by special feeding programs to 
feed the residential children and deserving day scholars of Siragu Montessori 
School and Bharathamatha School.

Whole day special feeding - INR 24000 and the break-up cost Rs.5000 for 
Breakfast, 10000 for lunch, 4000 for evening snacks and Rs.5000 for Dinner.

An appeal to contribute during all the occasions in your family and message us 
the date of feeding and the occasion.

Through this successful initiative we can meet out the food cost as it is 
second top of our operating expenses.
