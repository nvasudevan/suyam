Muthuram, Founder Trustee of Suyam created this Campaign to support 
families and children who are affected by COVID-19 lock down and it's 
direct and indirect challenges. It is a battle period for everyone. When calls 
come from various sectors of community asking for help, we knock the doors of 
donors and well wishers and seek support to reach the benefits to Slum 
dwellers, Nomadic Tribes, Irulas, Migrant Workers and more.

We believe our effort and activites has impacted over 2 million+ lives. Let us 
join together to reach out support to more families through various modes of 
support.
