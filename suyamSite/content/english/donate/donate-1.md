### COVID-19 Campaign

Muthuram, Founder Trustee of Suyam created this Campaign to support 
families/people/children who are affected due to COVID-19 lock down and it's 
direct and indirect challenges. It's a battle period for everyone. When calls 
come from various sectors of community asking for help, we knock the doors of 
donors and well wishers and seek support to reach the benefits to Slum 
dwellers, Nomadic Tribes, Irulas, Migrant Workers and more.

So far over 2 million+ Lives Impacted through various relief activities and 
also get into rehabilitation support etc. Let's join together to reach out 
support to more families through various modes of support.

Donations to this NGO have 50% tax exemption for Indian donors.
