Our Siragu school was established in 2003 to give *FREE EDUCATION* to  
underprivileged Children. It started with 34 kids and now student strength has 
gone above 500. The children primarily come from begging community, street 
children, bonded laborers, from single parent families and disadvantaged 
communities. The school accommodates 125 residential children.

Books, Transport, Uniform, Food, everything is given free so that the children 
get education, who are the first generation learners.

Attention is given not only to the children, but also to their families and 
their community so that the growth is holistic.

Donations to this NGO have 50% tax exemption for Indian donors. Donations to 
Suyam are managed by Giveindia (Click on 'Donate' link).
