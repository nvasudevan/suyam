A Girl Childâ€™s Education up to higher studies has been one of the major focus 
areas of the Suyam charitable trust from the beginning. We at Suyam take care 
of girl children from the young age of 2 years and nurture them until they 
recontribute to trust and society. We run the Siragu Montessori school, Siragu 
hostel for girls, Siragu Industrial college and Siragu teenage girls hostel to 
better serve the needs of a girl child according to their age requirements.
