### Sponsor our Diwali

Suyam registered under Trust Act in the year 1999 (non formally since 1987) and also registered with FCRA Act, Also registered with Benevity Causes, USA and CAF America.

Through this campaign we plan to raise contributions which can support Diwali expenses. In the name of Diwali considering a special occasion, we buy one set of new clothes, inner garments, provide the children sumptuous food for whole day. Also if more funds raised we wish to give dry rations to Nomadic Tribe families.

We never buy crackers as a policy, all the funds get raised through this campaign will be helpful to buy new clothes, inner garments etc. If any amount saved, it will be used for purchase of uniform materials for Siragu.

Irulas and nomadic tribes community are also given a special attention, beyond Siragu we also support these families for Diwali.

Every single contribution will bring an impact in lives of people and spread the happiness.

Donations to this NGO have 50% tax exemption for Indian donors.
