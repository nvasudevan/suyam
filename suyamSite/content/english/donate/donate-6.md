Through this campaign we plan to raise contributions which can support Diwali 
expenses. In the name of Diwali considering a special occasion, we buy one set 
of new clothes, inner garments, provide the children sumptuous food for whole 
day. Also if more funds raised we wish to give dry rations to Nomadic Tribe 
families.

We never buy crackers as a policy, all the funds get raised through this 
campaign will be helpful to buy new clothes, inner garments etc. If any amount 
saved, it will be used for purchase of uniform materials for Siragu.

Irulas and nomadic tribes community are also given a special attention, beyond 
Siragu we also support these families for Diwali.

Every single contribution will bring an impact in lives of people and spread 
the happiness.
